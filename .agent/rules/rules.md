# 🚨 CRITICAL: DATABASE PROTECTION RULES 🚨

## 🚨 SECURITY RULES 🚨
1. Do not do this `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0`
2. Always set `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=1` or RESET to DEFAULT VALUE

## 🚨 PRISMA MIGRATION RULES - NEVER BREAK THESE 🚨

### ABSOLUTE RULES:
1. ❌ **NEVER use `prisma db push`**
2. ❌ **NEVER edit existing migration files** - Once applied, they are immutable
3. ❌ **NEVER modify the `prisma/migrations/` directory manually**
4. ✅ **ALWAYS use `prisma migrate dev --name descriptive_name`** for schema changes
5. ✅ **ALWAYS create a NEW migration** for any schema changes, never modify old ones

### IF SCHEMA CHANGES ARE NEEDED:
- **Step 1:** Edit `prisma/schema.prisma`
- **Step 2:** Run `npx prisma migrate dev --name descriptive_name`
- **Step 3:** Verify the generated migration looks correct
- **Step 4:** Commit both schema.prisma AND the new migration directory

### POSTGRESQL ENUM GOTCHA:
When adding enum values that are immediately used as defaults or in column changes, you MUST split the migration into two transactions:
```sql
-- Step 1: Add enum value
ALTER TYPE "EnumName" ADD VALUE IF NOT EXISTS 'NEW_VALUE';
COMMIT;
BEGIN;
-- Step 2: Use the enum value
ALTER TABLE "TableName" ALTER COLUMN "column" SET DEFAULT 'NEW_VALUE';
```

### CUSTOM SQL MIGRATIONS:
When you need to add database features that Prisma can't express (triggers, custom indexes, check constraints, etc.):
1. **Create empty migration:** `npx prisma migrate dev --name add_custom_feature --create-only`
2. **Write custom SQL** in the generated `migration.sql` file
3. **Apply migration:** `npx prisma migrate dev`
4. **Commit the migration file** along with schema.prisma

Common use cases: CHECK constraints, partial indexes, triggers, GIN/GIST indexes, RLS policies, materialized views.

### NEVER DO THIS:
- `npx prisma db push`
- Editing files in `prisma/migrations/*/migration.sql`
- `npx prisma migrate resolve` without explicit user permission
- `npx prisma migrate reset` without explicit user permission (see database protection rules)

### IF DRIFT IS DETECTED:
- **ASK THE USER FIRST** before running any commands
- Explain the situation and options
- Let the user decide whether to reset, baseline, or manually fix

## ⛔ ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION - NEVER RUN PRISMA MIGRATE RESET

**THIS IS A DESTRUCTIVE COMMAND THAT DROPS THE ENTIRE DATABASE AND DESTROYS ALL DATA**

### FORBIDDEN COMMANDS:
- ❌ `prisma-migrate-reset` tool (NEVER use this tool)
- ❌ `prisma migrate reset` (NEVER run this command)
- ❌ `npx prisma migrate reset` (NEVER run this command)
- ❌ Any command that drops or resets the database

### REQUIRED PROCEDURE FOR SCHEMA DRIFT OR MIGRATION ISSUES:

1. **STOP IMMEDIATELY** - Do not proceed without user approval
2. **ASK THE USER FIRST** - Explain the situation and options
3. **SUGGEST NON-DESTRUCTIVE SOLUTIONS:**
   - Manually write and run SQL ALTER TABLE commands
   - Create a new migration: `prisma migrate dev --name descriptive_name`
   - Provide the exact SQL needed and let user decide how to apply it
4. **WAIT FOR USER DECISION** - Never make destructive changes automatically

### IF UNSURE:
- Default to asking the user
- Explain the implications of each approach
- Let the user make the final decision
- Remember: It's better to ask than to destroy data

# 🚨 CRITICAL: RUST DATA MANGEMENT RULES 🚨
1. THE APPLICATION CAN BE HOSTED AS A STAND ALONE SERVER, OR IN A "SOLO" MODE THAT HAS A SERVER ON LOCALHOST AND A UI ON LOCALHOST. IN OTHER MODES THE UI CAN CONNECT TO A SERVER REMOTELY.
2. DON'T JUST START WRITING RAW SQL QUERIRES TO INSERT DATA INTO THE DATABASE. ALWAYS USE THE PRISMA FUNCTIONS PROVIDED BY THE GENERATED PRISMA CLIENT.
3.THE DATA SHOULD NEVER LIVE ON THE CLIENT, DATA PROCESSING (SUCH AS NEXTFLOW) MAY BE DONE ON THE CLIENT. BUT THE SERVER IS ONLY A STORAGE/API FACILITY.
